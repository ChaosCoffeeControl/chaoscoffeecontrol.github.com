Thanks to massive amounts of caffeine and peer pressure, we will be
providing an excellent coffee experience at the [C3MA village](http://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/wiki/C3MA) on the
camp. Gonium will bring his modified [Miss Silvia](http://gonium.net/blog/2011/04/14/pid-ftw!/) and additional equipment. If everything goes well we will also habe Dome's Silvia up and running &mdash; this should improve the flat white throughput significantly.

We have ordered a huge amount of [Espresso Monaco](https://www.caffe-fausto.de/Espresso_espresso_monaco_250g.html):

It has been roasted on July 26th, so it is really fresh and delicious.
If you're at the camp, make sure to drop by. And don't forget to tip :D
