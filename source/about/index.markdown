Coffee and geekery have a long history. We promote good coffee, really
good coffee. Not Starbucks-good. More
[Godshot](http://godshot.de/)-good. Getting a perfect [flat
white](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_white) is by no means simple,
it depends on knowledge, skill and equipment.

Both knowledge and equipment is something nerds find very attractive,
thus we set out to build equipment and learn how to brew espresso. And
flat white. Sometimes we end up with a cappuccino, but that's okay. The
skillbuilding is in progress.

Currently, we have built an open-source PID controller for the Rancilio
Silvia. And another super-secret project is on its way. All code lives
at [github](https://github.com/ChaosCoffeeControl).

Stay tuned.
